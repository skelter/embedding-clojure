Why creating static methods in classes with :gen-class awkward.  
Stu replies: not a priority for the team to make doing that easy.  Consider interop the other way.

Stu mentioned O'Riley Clojure Cookbook

Stu asks: What things out there strike you as painful or weird? 
*  name spaces are not packages and are not classes
*  lazy sequences and remembering to use apply


Stu dreams of a curated Repl and gotcha cookbook.  Repl with custom reader and eval step.  Racket community has done this.  There is so much more intelligence that could easily be added to the repl.
Steve wishes Sam was here, to talk about repeating the past and dreams of a better future.

Should I use datomic or am I learning too much?  Stu: try it in anger for a half-day, using the query laguage; see if you like it.
